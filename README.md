A quick little utility to randomly generate cyphers for the Cypher RPG game.  Note that, at present,
this utilitly only generates sublte cyphers.

Usage:

Where "n" is the number of cyphers to generate.

  -f, -full                Full (non-Roll20 formatted) output
  -u, -unique              Do not select the same cypher twice
