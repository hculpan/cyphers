weapon the nodule is attached to strikes a
solid creature or object, it generates a burst
of energy that teleports the creature or object
struck an immediate distance in a random
direction (not up or down). The teleported
creature’s actions (including defense) are
hindered on its next turn (hindered by two
steps if the cypher is level 5 or higher).

Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to armor
Effect: For the next 28 hours, each time (but
not more than once per round) the wearer
of the armor the nodule is attached to is
struck hard enough to inflict damage, they
teleport an immediate distance in a random
direction (not up or down). Since the wearer
is prepared for this effect and their foe is
not, the wearer’s defenses are eased for

disk immediately unleashes microfilaments
that enter the brain. Within five minutes,
the creature can understand the words of
a specific language keyed to the graft (two
languages if the cypher is level 5 or higher).
This is true even of creatures that do not
normally have a language. If the creature
could already understand the language,
the cypher has no effect. Once the graft
attaches, the effect is permanent, and
this device no longer counts against the
number of cyphers that a PC can bear.

no more than once per round), they teleport
to a spot they desire within immediate
range. Since the wearer is prepared for
this effect and their foe is not, the wearer’s
defenses are eased for one round after they
teleport (eased by two steps if the cypher is
level 6 or higher).

sources. Its movement is blocked by any
physical or energy barrier.
INSTANT SERVANT
Level: 1d6
Usable: Handheld device
Effect: Small device expands into a humanoid
automaton that is roughly 2 feet (60 cm)
tall. Its level is equal to the cypher level and
it can understand the verbal commands
of the character who activates it. Once
the servant is activated, commanding it
is not an action. It can make attacks or
perform actions as ordered to the best of
its abilities, but it cannot speak.
The automaton has short-range movement
but never goes farther than long range
away from the character who activated it.
At the GM’s discretion, the servant might
have specialized knowledge, such as how
to operate a particular device. Otherwise,
it has no special knowledge. In any case,

MACHINE CONTROL IMPLANT
Level: 1d6 + 2
Type: Internal - Pill
Type: Wearable - Disk that adheres to forehead,
temporary tattoo
Usable: Injector
Effect: When activated, the cypher splits into
two pieces. One is affixed to a numenera
device and the other to a character. The
character can then use their mind to
control the device at long range, bidding it
to do anything it could do normally. Thus,
a device could be activated or deactivated,
and a vehicle could be piloted. The control
lasts for ten minutes per cypher level, and
once the device is chosen, it cannot be
changed.
MAGNETIC ATTACK DRILL
Level: 1d6 + 2
Usable: Small sphere with a thick screw
protrusion
Effect: The user throws this cypher at a target

MAGNETIC MASTER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Type: Wearable - Gloves with metal plates
Usable: Small pyramid-shaped metallic device
Effect: Establishes a connection with one
metal object within short range that a
human could hold in one hand. After this
connection is established, the user can
move or manipulate the object anywhere

helm affixed to a foe’s head to and fro. The
connection lasts for ten rounds per cypher
level.
MAGNETIC SHIELD

or do something else that happens quickly.
MENTAL SCRAMBLER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Usable: Complex metal and glass device
Effect: Two rounds after being activated, the
device creates an invisible field that fills an
area within short range and lasts for one
minute. The field scrambles the mental
processes of all thinking creatures. The
effect lasts as long as they remain in the
field and for 1d6 rounds after, although an
Intellect defense roll is allowed each round
to act normally (both in the field and after
leaving it). Each mental scrambler is keyed
to a specific effect. Roll for effect:
01–30 Victims cannot act.
31–40 Victims cannot speak.

Type: Internal - Injection into fingertip
Type: Wearable - Glove
Usable: Device similar to hilt
Effect: Produces a 6-inch (15 cm) blade that’s
the same level as the cypher. The blade cuts
through any material of a level lower than its
own. If used as a weapon, it is a light weapon
that ignores Armor of a level lower than its
own. The blade lasts for ten minutes.
MOTION SENSOR
Level: 1d6 + 2
Type: Internal - Injection into spine
Type: Wearable - Amulet
Usable: Disk that can be affixed to the floor or
another surface
Effect: Indicates when any movement occurs
within short range, or when large creatures
or objects move within long range (the
cypher distinguishes between the two).
It also indicates the number and size of
the creatures or objects in motion. Once
activated, it operates for one hour per
cypher level.
PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT FIELD
Level: 1d6 + 2
Type: Wearable - Belt, medallion, ring
Usable: Handheld device
Effect: Creates an aura of temperature and
atmosphere that will sustain a human
safely for 28 hours. The aura extends to 1
foot (30 cm) around the user (double that
radius if the cypher is level 7 or higher). It
does not protect against sudden flashes of
temperature change (such as from a heat
ray). A small number of these cyphers (1%)
accommodate the preferred environment
of a nonhuman, nonterrestrial creature.

surface, elaborate spray atomizer
Effect: Puts a portion of a physical structure (like
a wall or floor) out of phase for one hour. It
affects an area equal to one 5-foot (1.5 m)
cube per cypher level. While the area is out of
phase, creatures and objects can pass freely
through it as if it were not there, although
one cannot see through it, and it blocks light.
POISON (EMOTION)
Level: 1d6 + 2
Type: Internal - Pill, ingestible or injectable liquid
Type: Wearable - Lipstick, false fingertip, ring with needle
Usable: Injector
Effect: The victim feels a specific emotion for
