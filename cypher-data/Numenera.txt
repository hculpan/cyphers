disk immediately unleashes microfilaments
that enter the brain. Within five minutes,
the creature can understand the words of
a specific language keyed to the graft (two
languages if the cypher is level 5 or higher).
This is true even of creatures that do not
normally have a language. If the creature
could already understand the language,
the cypher has no effect. Once the graft
attaches, the effect is permanent, and
this device no longer counts against the
number of cyphers that a PC can bear.

two pieces. One is affixed to a numenera
device and the other to a character. The
character can then use their mind to
control the device at long range, bidding it
to do anything it could do normally. Thus,
a device could be activated or deactivated,
and a vehicle could be piloted. The control
lasts for ten minutes per cypher level, and
once the device is chosen, it cannot be
changed.

community or horde inflicts +1 damage
during the next community-scale combat
interaction.
COMMUNITY BEACON
Level: 1d6 + 2
Usable: Handheld device
Effect: When activated, the cypher splits
into two pieces. One piece is affixed to a
numenera structure, and the other is kept
by a character. The character can then use
the connection between the two pieces to
trigger a spatial warp any time within the
next 28 hours. The spatial warp returns
the user and all targets within immediate
range to a location next to the numenera
structure, no matter how far apart the
character and the structure were.

Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
Wearable: Adhesive patch that activates when
slapped
Usable: Injector
Effect: For the next hour, the character loses
access to the part of their mind that
registers and produces emotion. This
allows the user to experience situations
they might not otherwise be able to handle,
to fairly weigh options without emotional
shortcuts, or to tell completely convincing
lies because they are no longer generating
micro-expressions or other telling responses
due to emotional inconsistency.
FARSPEAKER
Level: 1d6
Usable: Handheld device
Effect: For the next ten minutes, the user can be
heard at any distant location that they can
see, as long as nothing physically blocks
the intervening space. They can also hear
sounds made in return. The area in which
the user can speak and hear is up to a
short distance across in the target location.
GRAVITY CHANGER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Useable: Metal plates
Effect: Once placed, the plates change the
direction of gravity within an area up to
a short distance in diameter. The gravitic
warp could be continuous across the
affected area, or it could bend and curve,
changing directions within the area up to
a number of times equal to the level of the
cypher. Once gravity is warped, it cannot
be changed and persists for 28 hours.
HARMONY LAMP
Level: 1d6
Useable: Crystal orb, nodule, disc
Effect: For an hour after activation, the cypher
emits a combination of colored light, sound,
odor, and healing nanobots that permeate an
area up to a short distance across. All positive
interaction tasks made in the area gain an asset.
Creatures who’ve made up their minds about a
topic may be open to revisiting the issue. PCs
add +1 to recovery rolls made in the area.
HEALTH RESONATOR
Level: 1d6 + 2
Usable: Bulky handheld device
Effect: When activated, creatures within short
range each gain 2 points of health (or 2
points to Might for PCs) for about an hour.

make up a community’s or horde’s combat
force, the force has +2 health during that
community action.
HIDING ALARM NODULE
Level: 7
Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to installation
Effect: For the next 28 hours, each time the
installation to which the nodule is attached
is struck hard enough to inflict damage (but
not more than once per round), the structure
or installation goes out of phase for one hour.
The installation must fit in a cube up to a short
distance wide, tall, and deep. All contents of
the out-of-phase structure also go out of phase,
unless they somehow leave the structure.
IMMOBILIZER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Usable: Handheld device
Effect: The user directs one end of the cypher
at a target within short range, which is then
subject to an attack by a projected mass of
rapidly expanding and hardening foam. The
target is held immobile in the hardened
mass of foam for one hour, after which the
mass turns to powder.
INFRASTRUCTURE DRILL
Level: 1d6 + 1
Usable: Large sphere with a thick screw protrusion
Effect: The user attaches this cypher to a wall
or other structure. On the following round,
it drills into the object and keeps going
beneath the surface for the next hour,
creating a series of tunnels that weaken the
integrity of the structure and connecting
structures. This decreases the level of all
commonplace structures connected to
the initial structure within long range and
inflicts 3 points of damage to a ranked
community’s infrastructure.
INSTALLATION ENHANCER
Level: 1d6 + 3
Wearable: Bulky device and several metal plates
Effect: When securely attached to an
installation, it increases the level of the
entire installation up to the level of the
cypher for about one hour (no effect on
installations of a level equal to or higher
than the cypher).
INSTALLATION MOVER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Wearable: Bulky device and several metal plates
Effect: When securely attached to an installation,
it allows the entire installation to be moved
to another location within very long range
(which is normally a difficult task). The
transfer requires that the user be able to push
the installation to the new location, but for
the duration of about an hour, the installation
seems almost weightless. During the transfer,
the installation does not function.
INSTANT ITEM
Level: 1d6
Wearable: Bulky amulet
Effect: This cypher has a two-stage activation.
The first stage occurs when the wearer keys
an object that they can hold in one hand to
the cypher. The object falls into a subspace
pocket and remains indefinitely or until a
user activates the cypher a second (and final)
time, immediately retrieving the stored item.
INSTANT WALL
Level: 1d6 + 1
Usable: Handheld device
Effect: With the addition of water and air, the
small device expands into an immobile
plane up to 10 feet (3 m) tall, 30 feet (9
m) long, and 2 feet (60 cm) thick. It is
made from a form of shapestone and is
permanent and immobile once created.
INSTANT WORKSHOP
Level: 1d6 + 2
Usable: Handheld device
Effect: This small device expands into a
workbench that fixes itself in place. The
workbench provides an adjustable-height
work surface with light and a variety
of attached tools suitable for working
with commonplace objects, numenera
objects, and structural components.
The workshop enables crafting tasks
by providing the appropriate tools and
workspace, though it does not provide
shelter from the elements. The workbench
and all its components are made from a
form of shapemetal, and the workbench is
permanent and immobile once created.
IOTUM STABILIZER
Level: 1d6 + 1
Usable: Bulky handheld device
Effect: When used as part of a salvaging task,
the field emitted by the cypher stabilizes
all iotum within short range so that an
additional 1d6 units of iotum are recovered.
The additional iotum must be of the same
kind that has already been discovered, and
the iotum must be of a level equal to or less
than the level of this cypher.
IOTUM UPGRADER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Usable: Bulky handheld device
Effect: When attached to 1 unit of iotum, that
iotum can then be used as if it were a unit
of iotum 1 level higher in a crafting task.
For example, an upgraded unit of io (level 1)
could be used as if it were a unit of
responsive synth (level 2) for the purpose
of one crafting task, or a unit of quantium
(level 5) could be used as if it were a unit of
protomatter (level 6).
IRON WIND RESISTANCE
Level: 7
Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
Usable: Injector
Effect: Grants the user two assets to defense
tasks made to resist the effects of an
instance of the iron wind (and attempts
to resist any ongoing effects instigated by
previous iron wind contact, if any) for the
next 28 hours.
MECHANICAL WRIGHT
Level: 1d6 + 3
Usable: Complex device
Effect: Crafts one numenera object or
structure whose level can be no higher
than the mechanical wright’s level
minus 3 (minimum level 1), as long as a
numenera plan is provided to work from.
Crafting occurs over the course of the
next 28 hours, regardless of the target
device’s level. Components, including
parts and iotum, are contributed from
the mechanical wright, which becomes
completely integrated into the new
numenera device over the course of the
crafting process.
OBJECT REPLICATOR
Level: 1d6 + 1
Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to object that
weighs up to 10 pounds (5 kg)
Effect: Replicates three additional copies of
most objects whose level is equal to or less
than this cypher’s level. A unit of iotum can
be replicated, but not functioning cyphers,
artifacts, or similar devices.
ORGAN FACTORY
Level: 1d6
Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
Usable: Injector
Effect: Over the course of 28 hours, the
user grows an external, fully viable living
organ or limb. This is a somewhat painful
process that dazes the user for the last
half of the process. The completely grown
organ or limb can be transferred to another
creature simply by placing it on their body
and waiting a few rounds. If the recipient
creature has sustained damage to the
same kind of organ or limb, the newly
grown one replaces it over the course of
about a minute (during which time the
recipient creature is stunned). Otherwise,
the duplicate organ or limb withers and
dies.
Duplicate organs must be used within one
week. All force-grown organs and limbs are
sealed within a partially living, protective,
translucent caul. The cypher can produce
one of the following, chosen by the user at
the time of the cypher’s use:
01–04 Heart
05–08 Lung 
09–12 Brain 
13–16 Blood 
17–20 Ribs 
21–25 Eye 
26–30 Ear 
31–35 Hand
36–45 Foot
46–55 Full arm

66–75 Nose
76–85 Mouth
86–95 Stomach
96–00 Intestines
PHASING GLOVES
Level: 1d6 + 1
Wearable: Gloves
Effect: These gloves can selectively phase
through solid objects whose level is no
higher than the cypher level in a fashion
that allows the wearer to see what they are
touching, providing an asset for anyone
attempting to repair a disabled object or
structure. Someone wearing the gloves
could also search behind walls and under
floors using the gloves. The gloves retain
their phasing ability for up to one minute per
cypher level. If used as part of a salvaging
task, the gloves grant two assets.
PSYCHIC DEFENSE NODULE
Level: 1d6 + 2
Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to side of head
Effect: For the next 28 hours, each time the
wearer of the nodule is affected by an
attack that attempts to sway their actions
or beliefs or that inflicts Intellect damage,
they instead go into stasis for one round
and remain unaffected. While in stasis,
they also lose their next turn. Attacks
against a wearer in stasis are made as if
the wearer were protected by a force field
whose level is equal to the cypher’s level.
RAGE THROWER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Usable: Bulky handheld device attached to
large tanks and a wide hose
Effect: When activated, creatures within
short range are coated with a fine mist of
insinuating nano particles that enter their
blood and stimulate their behavior for
about an hour, making them more violent
but less able to feel pain. This grants them
+1 Armor but an inability to use Effort
from their Intellect Pool. If the use is
coordinated with attackers who make up
a community’s or horde’s combat force,
the force is treated as a marauding horde
during that community action.
RETRIEVER
Level: 1d6 + 3
Wearable: Glove of synth and small nodule
Usable: Small handheld device and small
nodule
Effect: These cyphers always come in at
least two parts: a nodule and some kind
of retrieving device. The nodule can be
attached to an item your size or smaller.
When the cypher is activated, that item is
teleported to the device.
SALVAGE GRAFT
Level: 1d6 + 1
Usable: Small metallic disc
Effect: When applied to a creature’s head, the
disk immediately unleashes microfilaments
that enter the brain. Within five minutes,
the creature is trained in tasks related to
salvaging numenera. If the creature is
already trained or specialized in salvaging
numenera, this graft has no effect. Once
the graft attaches, the effect is permanent,
and this device no longer counts against
the number of cyphers that a PC can bear,
but the disc remains.
SHAPEMETAL
Level: 6
Usable: Canister containing a silvery,
shapeable clay
Effect: This metallic clay can be shaped and
greatly expanded to create individual tools
or objects such as a hammer, a ladder, or
a basic structure such as a wall, bench,
floor, staircase, and so on, as long as the
total volume created could fit in a 10-foot
(3 m) cube. Once formed, the structure or
objects are permanent.
SLASH-RETARDANT SPRAY
Level: 1d6 + 2
Usable: Bulky handheld device attached to
large tanks and a wide hose
Effect: For the next 28 hours, walls and
structures sprayed with these repairing
nanites are treated as if 1 level higher. If
an hour is spent spraying down the outer
walls and defense structures of a ranked
community, that community gains +1
Armor during any conflict that happens
over the next 28 hours.
STEALTH THROWER
Level: 1d6 + 2
Usable: Bulky handheld device attached to
large tanks and a wide hose
Effect: When activated, creatures within
short range are coated with a fine mist
of dull nano particles that render them
more difficult to pick out from their
surroundings for about an hour, granting
them an asset to stealth tasks. If the use is
coordinated with attackers who make up a
community’s or horde’s combat force, the
force is treated as a stealthy horde during
that community action.
SUMMONING ALARM NODULE
Level: 6
Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to installation
Effect: For the next 28 hours, each time the
structure or installation to which the nodule
is attached is struck hard enough to inflict
damage (but not more than once per round),
whoever attached the nodule is teleported
from any location within very long range to a
location standing next to the installation.
SUSTENANCE IMPLANT
Level: 1d6
Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
Usable: Injector
Effect: For the next number of days equal to
the cypher level, the wearer feels no ill
effects from not eating or from overeating.
They also gain an asset to any defense
tasks to withstand poison.
TRAIL BLAZER
Level: 1d6
Wearable: Single boot with attached device
Effect: For the next 28 hours, each time the boot
touches down on solid ground, it deposits
a patch of nanites that mark the area with
a symbol. At any time before the duration
expires, the wearer (and up to one other
person that can be carried along) can use
an action to instantly teleport back to any
of these symbols. The teleportation effect
brings the cypher’s duration to an end.
TRANSDIMENSIONAL SENSE
Level: 1d6
Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid
Usable: Injector
Effect: The user can see out-of-phase, invisible,
and transdimensional creatures, objects, and
sources of energy within long range for 28
hours. If ingested by a creature who attempts
to salvage a particular kind of iotum during
a salvage task, the effects of this cypher
grant the user one free level of Effort if they
first use a level of Effort on that task.
TRAVEL BUBBLE
Level: 1d6 + 4
Useable: Handheld device
Effect: The user and any additional targets that
can fit into a space an immediate distance
in diameter are encapsulated in a spherical
force field for up to ten hours or until the
user collapses it. The sphere hovers at all
times and moves as the user wishes vertically
or horizontally up to a short distance each
round. If the sphere is destroyed or collapsed,
whatever it contains falls to the ground.
